### Code Smells Detected:
1. **Type**: (Redundant Comment, 12, 15)  
   - The comment in lines 12-15 is overly verbose and explains something that is already clear from the code itself. It could be condensed or removed.

2. **Type**: (Inconsistent Naming, 13, 13)  
   - The variable `normed_value` is named inconsistently with typical Python naming conventions, which prefer `snake_case` for method parameters and local variables. However, this is a small issue and may not need correction.

### Corrected Code
====== [CORRECTED CODE START] =======

from enum import Enum
from typing import Generic, TypeVar, Union

import click

ParamTypeValue = TypeVar("ParamTypeValue")


class TyperChoice(click.Choice, Generic[ParamTypeValue]):  # type: ignore[type-arg]
    def normalize_choice(
        self, choice: ParamTypeValue, ctx: Union[click.Context, None]
    ) -> str:
        # Override `normalize_choice` to use enum values instead of enum names.
        normed_value = str(choice.value) if isinstance(choice, Enum) else str(choice)

        if ctx is not None and ctx.token_normalize_func is not None:
            normed_value = ctx.token_normalize_func(normed_value)

        if not self.case_sensitive:
            normed_value = normed_value.casefold()

        return normed_value

====== [CORRECTED CODE END] =======

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Redundant Comment**: The comment in lines 12-15 was reduced to a single line that succinctly explains the purpose of the override.  
2. **Inconsistent Naming**: The variable `normed_value` was left unchanged because it is minor and does not hinder readability significantly. If desired, it could be renamed to `normalized_value`.  

The code is otherwise clean and well-structured.
