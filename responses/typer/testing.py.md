### Code Analysis

The provided Python code snippet appears to be well-structured and does not exhibit significant code smells. However, there are a few minor improvements that can be made:

1. **Naming Improvement**: The method `invoke_with_retries` is defined as an instance method (not decorated with `@staticmethod` or `@classmethod`), but it does not use `self`. Either it should be decorated as a `@classmethod` or `@staticmethod`, or it should be moved outside the class.

2. **Lack of Documentation**: The `invoke` method does not have a docstring explaining its purpose, parameters, or return values.

### Suggested Refactorings

1. **Refactor `invoke_with_retries`**: Convert it into a static method or move it outside the class.
2. **Add Docstring for `invoke`**: Include a docstring to improve code readability and maintainability.

### Code Smells Detected:
None

### Explanation:
The code does not exhibit significant code smells. Minor improvements were made to enhance readability and maintainability, including documenting the `invoke` method and properly marking `invoke_with_retries` as a static method.
