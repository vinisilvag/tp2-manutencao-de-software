The given code snippet swaps the values of two variables, `x` and `y`, using a temporary variable `aux`. While the code is functional, it exhibits a **code smell** known as **"Primitive Obsession"**. This smell occurs when primitive data types (e.g., integers, strings, or temporary variables) are used excessively instead of encapsulating the logic into a more meaningful structure or method.

### Why is this a Code Smell?
- The use of a temporary variable (`aux`) and explicit swapping logic makes the code less readable and more prone to errors if the logic is reused or modified in multiple places.
- Swapping values is a common operation, and the lack of abstraction (e.g., a helper function or utility method) makes the code less reusable and harder to maintain.

### Refactoring Suggestions:
1. **Encapsulate the Swap Logic in a Function**:
   Create a reusable function to swap values, which improves readability and reusability.
   ```python
   def swap(a, b):
       return b, a
   
   x, y = swap(x, y)
   ```

2. **Use Tuple Unpacking**:
   In Python, you can swap values without a temporary variable using tuple unpacking, which is more concise and idiomatic.
   ```python
   x, y = y, x
   ```

3. **Create a Utility Class or Module**:
   If swapping is used frequently in the codebase, consider encapsulating such utility functions in a separate module or class.
   ```python
   class SwapUtils:
       @staticmethod
       def swap(a, b):
           return b, a
   
   x, y = SwapUtils.swap(x, y)
   ```

### Conclusion:
The most prominent code smell in the snippet is **Primitive Obsession**. By encapsulating the swap logic in a function or using idiomatic Python features like tuple unpacking, the code can be made cleaner, more readable, and easier to maintain.
