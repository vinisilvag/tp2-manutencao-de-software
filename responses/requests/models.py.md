### Code Smells Detected:
1. **Type**: (Duplicate Code, 1297, 1299)  
   **Explanation**: The logic for checking if the status code indicates a client error or server error is duplicated in `_check_for_client_error`, `_check_for_server_error`, and `is_error_status`.

2. **Type**: (Feature Envy, 1250, 1260)  
   **Explanation**: The method `_process_request_headers_for_feature_envy` accesses and processes data from the `request` object more than its own data, indicating Feature Envy.

3. **Type**: (Dead Code, 128, 142)  
   **Explanation**: The `_initialize_future_feature`, `_apply_future_optimization`, and related code are unused and seem to be placeholders for a future feature that is not implemented yet.

### Corrected Code:
```python
====== [CORRECTED CODE START] =======
# ... (Previous code remains unchanged until the affected sections)

def _check_for_client_error(self):
    """Verifica se o status code indica um erro de cliente (4xx)."""
    return 400 <= self.status_code < 500

def _check_for_server_error(self):
    """Verifica se o status code indica um erro de servidor (5xx)."""
    return 500 <= self.status_code < 600

def is_error_status(self):
    """Combina as verificações de erro de cliente e servidor."""
    return self._check_for_client_error() or self._check_for_server_error()

# Removed dead code related to future feature optimizations

# Removed Feature Envy method `_process_request_headers_for_feature_envy` and its calls.

# ... (Rest of the code remains unchanged)
====== [CORRECTED CODE END] =======
```

### Summary of Corrections:
1. **Duplicate Code**: Combined the duplicated logic into a single method `is_error_status` that utilizes `_check_for_client_error` and `_check_for_server_error`.
2. **Feature Envy**: Removed the `_process_request_headers_for_feature_envy` method to avoid unnecessary coupling with the `request` object.
3. **Dead Code**: Removed the unused `_initialize_future_feature`, `_apply_future_optimization`, and related code to clean up the codebase.

These changes improve code maintainability, reduce redundancy, and remove unused functionality that could confuse future developers.
