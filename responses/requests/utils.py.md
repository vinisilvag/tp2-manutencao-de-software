After analyzing the code, I found a few code smells that could be improved. Below are the identified code smells and the corrected code.

### Code Smells Detected:
1. **Type**: (DeadCode, 398, 404)
   - **Description**: The code block inside the `if False:` condition will never be executed, making it dead code. Additionally, the `_debug_variable` and `another_unused_variable` are defined but never used.
   
2. **Type**: (MagicNumber, 733, 733)
   - **Description**: The number `4` is used directly in the `guess_json_utf` function to slice the data. This is a magic number and should be replaced with a named constant for better readability.

3. **Type**: (LongMethod, 41, 102)
   - **Description**: The `super_len` method is relatively long and could be refactored into smaller, more focused methods.

    middle.  Quotes are removed automatically after parsing.

    It basically works like :func:`parse_set_header` just that items
    may appear multiple times and case sensitivity is preserved.

    The return value is a standard :class:`list`:

    >>> parse_list_header('token, "quoted value"')
    ['token', 'quoted value']

    To create a header from the :class:`list` again, use the
    :func:`dump_header` function.

====== [CORRECTED CODE END] =======

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Dead Code**: Removed the unused debug code and variables inside the `if False:` block in the `parse_list_header` function.
2. **Magic Number**: Introduced a constant `DATA_SAMPLE_SIZE` to replace the magic number `4` in the `guess_json_utf` function.
3. **Long Method**: Refactored the `super_len` method into smaller helper methods (`_get_file_length_from_fileno` and `_get_file_length_from_tell`) to improve readability and maintainability.
