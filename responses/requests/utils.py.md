### Code Smells Detected:
1. **Type**: (`Dead Code`, 306, 312)

### Corrected Code
```python
====== [CORRECTED CODE START] =======
# From mitsuhiko/werkzeug (used with permission).
def parse_list_header(value):
    """Parse lists as described by RFC 2068 Section 2.

    In particular, parse comma-separated lists where the elements of
    the list may include quoted-strings.  A quoted-string could
    contain a comma.  A non-quoted string could have quotes in the
    middle.  Quotes are removed automatically after parsing.

    It basically works like :func:`parse_set_header` just that items
    may appear multiple times and case sensitivity is preserved.

    The return value is a standard :class:`list`:

    >>> parse_list_header('token, "quoted value"')
    ['token', 'quoted value']

    To create a header from the :class:`list` again, use the
    :func:`dump_header` function.

    :param value: a string with a list header.
    :return: :class:`list`
    :rtype: list
    """
    result = []
    for item in _parse_list_header(value):
        if item[:1] == item[-1:] == '"':
            item = unquote_header_value(item[1:-1])
        result.append(item)
    
    return result

```

### Explanation:
- **Dead Code**: The code block from line 306 to 312 is never executed because it's inside an `if False:` condition. This block of code serves no purpose and can be safely removed to improve code readability and maintainability. Removing dead code reduces the complexity of the codebase and makes it easier to understand and maintain.
