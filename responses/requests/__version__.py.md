### Analysis

The provided code snippet is a metadata block for a Python package (likely the `requests` library). It defines constants such as the package title, description, version, author, license, and copyright information. 

#### Observations:
1. **No Duplicated Code**: All lines are unique and necessary for defining package metadata.
2. **No Long Methods**: There are no methods or functions in this snippet.
3. **No Magic Numbers**: The `__build__` variable uses a hexadecimal literal (`0x023204`), but this is explicit and part of the package versioning convention.
4. **No Poor Naming**: All variable names are clear and follow Python conventions for metadata attributes.

### Conclusion:
There are **no discernible code smells** in the provided snippet. The code is clean, concise, and serves its purpose effectively.
