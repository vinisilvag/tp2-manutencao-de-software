The provided code snippet is concise and does not exhibit any significant code smells. Let's break it down:

1. **Code Structure**: The code is simple and straightforward, with a single import and a conditional check to print the result of the `where()` function.
2. **Duplication**: There is no duplication of code.
3. **Long Methods**: There are no methods defined, just a single line of code in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.
4. **Magic Numbers**: There are no magic numbers present.
5. **Naming**: The naming is clear and appropriate. The function `where()` is well-named for its purpose.

Since no code smells are detected, the response is:

**Code Smells Detected:**  
None

**Corrected Code:**  
====== [CORRECTED CODE START] =======  
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

"""
requests.certs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This module returns the preferred default CA certificate bundle. There is
only one â€” the one from the certifi package.

If you are packaging Requests, e.g., for a Linux distribution or a managed
environment, you can change the definition of where() to return a separately
packaged CA bundle.
"""
from certifi import where

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(where())
```
====== [CORRECTED CODE END] =======  

No modifications or refactorings are necessary. The code is clean and adheres to good practices.
