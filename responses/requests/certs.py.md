### Analysis:

The provided Python code snippet is quite short and straightforward. It imports the `where` function from the `certifi` module and prints the result of calling this function when the script is executed directly. 

#### Code Smells Detected:

None.

### Explanation:

The code does not exhibit any typical code smells. It is concise, uses a well-known library (`certifi`), and has a clear purpose. The use of `if __name__ == "__main__":` is appropriate for allowing the script to be both importable and executable. 

### Corrected Code:

Since there is no discernible code smell, the code does not need any modifications.

```
====== [CORRECTED CODE START] =======
#!/usr/bin/env python

"""
requests.certs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This module returns the preferred default CA certificate bundle. There is
only one â€” the one from the certifi package.

If you are packaging Requests, e.g., for a Linux distribution or a managed
environment, you can change the definition of where() to return a separately
packaged CA bundle.
"""
from certifi import where

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(where())
====== [CORRECTED CODE END] =======
```

### Summary:

The code is clean and adheres to good practices, so no refactoring or modifications are necessary.
