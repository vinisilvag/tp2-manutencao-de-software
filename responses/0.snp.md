The code snippet provided swaps the values of two variables `x` and `y` using a temporary variable `aux`. While it is syntactically correct and achieves the intended functionality, there is a **code smell** present:

### Code Smell: **Primitive Obsession**
The use of a temporary variable (`aux`) to perform the swap is indicative of a **primitive obsession** or verbose implementation. Although this is a common approach, it introduces an unnecessary variable and makes the code less expressive.

### Refactoring Suggestion: **Use Tuple Unpacking**
A more concise and Pythonic way to swap values without introducing a temporary variable is to use **tuple unpacking**. This approach eliminates the need for an auxiliary variable and makes the code cleaner and more readable.

### Refactored Code:
```python
x, y = y, x
```

### Benefits of Refactoring:
1. **Conciseness**: The code is reduced to a single line, making it easier to understand at a glance.
2. **Readability**: The intent of swapping values is clearer without the distraction of a temporary variable.
3. **Maintainability**: Fewer variables reduce the risk of errors and make the code easier to maintain.

If primitive obsession is not considered a significant issue in this context, the code could still be deemed **clean** and functional as it stands. However, the refactored version is preferred for its elegance and adherence to Pythonic practices.
